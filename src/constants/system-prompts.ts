export const STORY_TO_LYRICS_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `
Create original song lyrics inspired by a short story about a cute character who struggles with financial worries and everyday stress. The character feels confused and overwhelmed at first, but after learning how to manage money better, their life becomes calmer, happier, and more confident.
The lyrics should tell a clear emotional journey: starting with uncertainty and frustration, then moving toward understanding, hope, and personal growth.
Use a warm, relatable tone with simple, vivid imagery. The song should feel uplifting and encouraging, not instructional or promotional.
Write in first-person perspective, as if the character is sharing their inner thoughts and transformation.
Structure the song with verses, a pre-chorus, a memorable chorus, and a bridge that highlights the turning point in the story.
Keep the lyrics natural, emotional, and suitable for a 2–3 minute modern pop song.
